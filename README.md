Project Overview:
The AI system demonstrates 95.5% accuracy in detecting dental anomalies using panoramic X-rays. This research project shows significant potential for clinical application. The current implementation serves as a proof-of-concept, requiring further development and clinical validation for real-world deployment. 1000 X-ray images were used for training the model collected from IAU Dentistry Faculty Hospital.

ðŸš€ Seeking Collaboration: 
This project is open for partnerships with healthcare institutions, AI researchers, and dental technology companies to advance development. Financial support and technical collaboration opportunities available.

Student researcher available for joint development initiatives.
